1. every function that was written contained the same main function except for the histogram function. Additionally, there were many loops in the code even though most of them could have been condensed into one loop to gather the required information. We could have also minimized the redundancy in the code by combining all the C programs into one file.
2. the value that was randomly generated in the code are uniformly distributed, meaning that not every number has the exact same value as the other numbers, even though they are very similar. after dividing the numbers into 10 equal parts, it was observed that each part contained approximately one-tenth of the total results. We believe that this is due to the statistical properties of the large number in probability theory, known as the law of large numbers.
